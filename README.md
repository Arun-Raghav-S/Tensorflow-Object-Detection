# Tensorflow-Object-Detection
This project is a machine learning model that detects food items in videos using TensorFlow and SSD MobileNet. The model is trained on the Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset, which contains over 330,000 images of 80 object categories, including food items.The video is first converted into individual frames, and the model then calculates the accuracy of detection for each frame in the video. The results are displayed in a user-friendly format.
This project was done under the guidance of Prof. Mitali Mukherjee (BSBE dept, IIT Jodhpur). It was a subsection of AR/VR app constructor for digital food experience.</br>
